# WebStudentList-Project

In this project we had to create a web application of a student book 
in which we can display students of a database, add students, 
edit and delete them in our site but also in a database but contrary to the 
last project, this time we had to use JPA and JSF and not JSP.

We used Apache Tomcat's servors to connect so to see the app we need to connect to Apache Tomcat.
